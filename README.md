# Apex Plugins
This repo contains my own plugins for Revenge, mostly ports from [Vencore](https://github.com/ApexTeamPL/Vencore)

# How to install?
Paste a plugin URL into the Plugins page of Revenge, following a basic format of:
```
https://apexteampl.github.io/Apex-Plugins/<PLUGIN_NAME>
```
## Or just copy plugin links from here!
- [Message Scheduler](https://apexteampl.github.io/Apex-Plugins/messageScheduler/) - schedule messages to be sent at specific time or after a delay! (port from Vencore) **NOTE: As mentioned by one of Revenge mods, this plugin MAY FALL under selfbotting along with the og one from vencord/vencore, thus won't be proxied and added to offical list, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**
- [More Alts]() - use more than 5 alts at Discord and easily switch between them from chat input
- [Read All](https://apexteampl.github.io/Apex-Plugins/ReadAll) - Read all server and DM notifications with single command - /readall (idea from btmc727)
