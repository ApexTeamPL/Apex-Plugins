# Apex Plugins
This repo contains my own plugins for Revenge, mostly ports from [Vencore](https://github.com/ApexTeamPL/Vencore)

# How to install?
Paste a plugin URL into the Plugins page of Revenge, following a basic format of:
```
https://apexteampl.github.io/Apex-Plugins/<PLUGIN_NAME>
```
## Or just visit check plugins here!
- [Message Scheduler](https://apexteampl.github.io/Apex-Plugins/messageScheduler/) - schedule messages to be sent at specific time or after a delay! (port from Vencore)
- [More Alts]() - use more than 5 alts at Discord and easily switch between them from chat input
